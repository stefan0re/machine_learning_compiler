## Hello Assembly
The data directory contains the function hello_assembly in the file hello_assembly.c.

Tasks

1. Use the GCC and Clang compilers to compile the function and generate assembly code.
2. In the generated assembly code generated by the two compilers:
    - Locate the string "Hello Assembly Language!".
    - Identify the instructions that the compilers insert to conform to the procedure call standard.
    - Identify the function call to libc that prints the string.
3. Write a C++ driver that calls the hello_assembly function and test your implementation.
